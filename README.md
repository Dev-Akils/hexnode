[Setup]
AppName=hexnode.com
AppVersion=18.0
command : [npx create-react-app .]

[Packages]
npm i lucide-react
npm i react-icons
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material
react-router-dom

[issues i faced during the Execution]
Problem Description:
The error occurs because the Link component from react-router-dom is being used without a proper router context.
Solution:
The Link component depends on a router (like BrowserRouter or HashRouter) to provide context for routing. Without this router context, the Link component fails to function and throws an error at runtime.
Key Points:
Link is for internal navigation within a React Router setup.
For external URLs, you should use a standard <a> tag instead of Link.
